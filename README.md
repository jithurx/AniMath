## 📚 Overview

The **Manim Math Visualization Generator** is a powerful, AI-assisted tool that bridges the gap between mathematical ideas and beautiful animations. By combining [Manim](https://www.manim.community/)—the leading engine for mathematical animations—with Google’s **Gemini AI**, you can generate professional-quality visuals from simple text descriptions.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**EXPERIMENTAL STATUS**: This project is in early development and may be highly unreliable. Expect inconsistent code generation, rendering issues, and potential crashes.

**AI DEPENDENCY**: Currently relies on Google's proprietary Gemini AI, requiring an API key and internet connection.

**ROADMAP**: Future releases will focus on stability improvements and integration with open-source AI alternatives to reduce proprietary dependencies.

Please consider this version as a proof-of-concept rather than production-ready software. We welcome your feedback to help improve future iterations!

### Ideal for:
- 👩‍🏫 **Teachers** explaining complex concepts visually  
- 👨‍🎓 **Students** creating engaging study material  
- 💻 **Content creators** building educational content  
- 🧪 **Researchers** visualizing theoretical models  


## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Conversion**: Turns math descriptions into Manim Python code   
- 🖱️ **No Coding Required**: Intuitive interface—just type and visualize  
- 📥 **Video Export**: Save animations for use in slides, videos, or lessons  
- 🔗 **Google Gemini Integration**: Powered by advanced generative AI  


## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection (for AI capabilities)
- A Google Gemini API Key → [Get yours here](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/manim-math-visualizer.git
   cd manim-math-visualizer
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

   This will:
   - Install all required dependencies (Manim, Pillow, Gemini SDK, etc.)
   - Configure FFmpeg and Cairo for rendering
   - Set up a virtual environment
   - Generate launch scripts

3. **Launch the App**
   - **Windows**: Double-click `main.py`
   - **macOS/Linux**: Run `./main.py` in the terminal

4. **Enter your Gemini API key** on first launch


## 🖥️ How to Use

1. **Describe your math concept**
   ```
   Examples:
   - Show a geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem
   - Visualize the convergence of sin(x) using its Taylor series
   - Illustrate a derivative as the limit of secant slopes
   ```

2. **Click “Generate Visualization”**
   - The AI will interpret and refine your prompt
   - Generate Manim code
   - Render and preview the animation

3. **Review Output**
   - Watch the animation instantly
   - Access the Manim code used
   - Find the video in `media/videos/`
